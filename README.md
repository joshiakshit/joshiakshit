## About me

I'm Akshit and I am currently a B. Tech Computer Science first year student at Galgotias Univerity. 

## Projects I am working on

I'm currently working on building an full stack e-commerce website from scratch with a few of my batchmates. I believe that this clon creation would help me improve my react skills and will make me a better web developer. And honestly, I love doing web development since i can actually see my results in real time and deploy my projects in the blink of an eye and it feels so rewarding. I'm hoping to finish this project by the end of this year and hopefully make it a commercial grade website.

## What I'm currently learning

I'm not learning anything specific right now, since I am focused on building my project. But as this project comes to an end I have plans of moving on to Java since I have mastered the basics and I am looking to take it to the advanced level now.

## Collaborations I am interested in
Anything related to web development would get me going!

## Want to strike a convo?
Just ask me what I'm doing currently and I'll zap you with an answer right away.

## Reach out to me 
You can connect with me on LinkedIn or here as well! Looking forward to connect and develop!
