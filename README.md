# About Me

Hi, I'm Akshit! I'm a first-year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science at Galgotias University.

# Projects I'm Working On

I'm currently collaborating with some classmates to build a full-stack e-commerce website from scratch. This project is a great opportunity for me to enhance my React skills and grow as a web developer. I love web development because I can see the results of my work in real-time, and deploying projects is incredibly rewarding. My goal is to complete this project by the end of the year and develop it into a commercial-grade website.

# What I'm Currently Learning

Right now, I'm focused on finishing my e-commerce project, so I'm not exploring any new topics at the moment. However, once it's completed, I plan to deepen my knowledge of Java, as I’ve already mastered the basics.

# Collaboration Interests

I’m eager to collaborate on any web development projects—let's create something amazing together!
